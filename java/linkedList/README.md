# Singly Linked List
it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (NEXT)

## Challenge

Create a LinkedList :

1- Create a Node class

2- Create a LinkedList class.

The methods :

1- Insert values to the LinkedList.

2- Check If the value exists in the LinkedList or not.

3- Print out the values of nodes following this format "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL".

## Approach & Efficiency

Insert: Takes an integer and creates a new node in the linked list that holds that value.

Includes:  loop throw the linked list using current pointer and check if the value of node mathces the value that has been passed as argument

toString: Returns a string containing all the values of the nodes of the linked list.
