# Reverse an Array

Write a function called insertShiftArray:

which takes in an array and a value to be added
and return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Whiteboard Process

![Reverse](array-insert-shift.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency

Depending on the size of the matrix, odd or even -> int midArray = array.length % 2 == 0 ? (array.length) / 2 : ((array.length) / 2) + 1;

i use for loop and add 3 conditions to add the new value in the middle of array with new array

return new array
