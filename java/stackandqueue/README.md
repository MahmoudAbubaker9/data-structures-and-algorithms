# Stacks and Queues

Stack : used to store data in a last in first out format, meaning that the last item added onto the stack is the first item that will be removed from it.

Queue : In the queue only two operations are allowed enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item.


## Challenge
This challenge about how to build and using the Stack and Queue to store nodes in it.

The Stack class should contain the following methods:

1. pop
2. push
3. peek
4. isEmpty

The queue class should contain the following methods:

1. enqueue
2. dequeue
3. peek
4. isEmpty


## Approach & Efficiency

For all method Time: O(1) and Space: O(1)

## API

stack are:

1. Push adds an element at the top of a stack.
2. Pop removes the topmost element of a stack
3. The peek() method returns the element on the top of the stack but does not remove it.
4. The empty() method returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise, it returns false.

Queues are:

1. Enqueue : this method adds an element to the end/rear of the queue
2. Dequeue : this method removes an element from the front of the queue
3. Peek : This function returns the value of the topmost element available in the stack.
4. IsEmpty : If the stack is empty, then this function will return a true value or else it will return a false value.
